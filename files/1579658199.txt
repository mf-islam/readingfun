The iconic timepiece, probably the single most sought-after watch in the world, is now in the possession of his daughter Clea, who wears it every day in his memory. Franklin Roosevelt wore an elegant gold Tiffany watch, gifted to him by a friend on his birthday, to the famous Yalta Conference where he shook the hands of Joseph Stalin and Winston Churchill. JFK\u2019s Omega worn to his presidential inauguration, Ralph Lauren\u2019s watch purchased from Andy Warhol\u2019s personal collection, Sir Edmund Hillary\u2019s Rolex worn during the first-ever summit of Mt. Everest . . . these and many more compose the stories of the world\u2019s most coveted watches captured in A Man and His Watch. Matthew Hranek, a watch collector and NYC men\u2019s style fixture, has traveled the world conducting firsthand interviews and diving into exclusive collections to gather the never-before-told stories of 76 watches, completed with stunning original photography of every single piece. Through these intimate accounts and Hranek\u2019s storytelling, the watches become more than just timepieces and status symbols; they represent historical moments, pioneering achievements, heirlooms, family mementos, gifts of affection, and lifelong friendships.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781579658199"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1579658199"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":176,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Design"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.2.1.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=dWMVDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=dWMVDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=dWMVDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=A+Man+and+His+Watch&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/books\/details?id=dWMVDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https:\/\/market.android.com\/details?id=book-dWMVDgAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":15.95,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":8.61,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/books\/details?id=dWMVDgAAQBAJ&rdid=book-dWMVDgAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":15950000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":8610000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/download\/A_Man_and_His_Watch-sample-epub.acsm?id=dWMVDgAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/download\/A_Man_and_His_Watch-sample-pdf.acsm?id=dWMVDgAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http:\/\/play.google.com\/books\/reader?id=dWMVDgAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"JFK\u2019s Omega worn to his presidential inauguration, Ralph Lauren\u2019s watch purchased from Andy Warhol\u2019s personal collection, Sir Edmund Hillary\u2019s Rolex worn during the first-ever summit of Mt.
