Never short of ways to stir up trouble in his hometown on the Mississippi River, Tom uses his wits to get both in and out of tight spots, often with Huck at his side. Featuring moments of significant social commentary, these interconnected tales essentially served as a dry run for Twain's notably weightier sequel, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"OTHER","identifier":"NYPL:33433074842398"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":290,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Adventure stories, American"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":314,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"3.4.4.0.full.3","imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=j5UgAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=j5UgAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=j5UgAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Adventures+of+Tom+Sawyer&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/books\/details?id=j5UgAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https:\/\/market.android.com\/details?id=book-j5UgAAAAMAAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FREE","isEbook":true,"buyLink":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/books\/details?id=j5UgAAAAMAAJ&rdid=book-j5UgAAAAMAAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api"},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"ALL_PAGES","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":true,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"downloadLink":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/download\/The_Adventures_of_Tom_Sawyer.epub?id=j5UgAAAAMAAJ&hl=&output=epub&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"downloadLink":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/download\/The_Adventures_of_Tom_Sawyer.pdf?id=j5UgAAAAMAAJ&hl=&output=pdf&sig=ACfU3U20FI5LAwBqUJIVNWAjVo-EcuJm9A&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http:\/\/play.google.com\/books\/reader?id=j5UgAAAAMAAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"FULL_PUBLIC_DOMAIN","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"The book that introduced the world to the iconic American characters of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, this 1876 novel by Mark Twain follows the mischievous exploits of the two young boys, who find themselves in situations both humorous ..."},"source":""}
